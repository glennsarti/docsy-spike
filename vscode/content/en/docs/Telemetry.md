  What and what is not collected and how to turn it off.

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for writing manifest and modules with Puppet and VS Code. We only collect data on which commands are executed. We do not collect any information about files, paths, etc. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in the [VS Code FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
