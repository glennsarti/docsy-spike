This is an experimental feature

The Puppet extension is able to debug the compilation of a Puppet manifest; much like the Go, PowerShell, and C# languages. The debugger supports:

* Line breakpoints but not conditions on those breakpoints
* Function breakpoints
* Exception breakpoints
* Call stack
* Variables, but only at the top stack frame
* Limited interactive debug console.  For example, you can assign a variable a value, but just as in regular Puppet you can't change its value later
* Step In, Out, and Over

The debugging features in the extension are based on the excellent ideas in [puppet-debugger](https://www.puppet-debugger.com/) by [Corey Osman](https://github.com/nwops).

#### Configuring the debug session

To debug a simple manifest in VS Code, press `F5` and VS Code will try to debug your currently active manifest by running the equivalent of `puppet apply`. Note that by default No Operation (`--noop`) is enabled so that your local computer will not be modified.

The [VSCode Debugging - Launch Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) website has instructions on how to configure the debug session with more advanced options.

#### Settings

- `manifest` - The manifest to apply.  By default this is the currently open file in the editor

- `noop` - Whether the `puppet apply` sets No Operation (NoOp) mode.  By default, this is set to true.  This means when running the debugger it will not make changes to your system. The [documentation about the puppet agent](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/man/apply.html#OPTIONS) has more information about `puppet apply` and and the `noop` option.

- `args` - Additional arguments to pass to `puppet apply`, for example `['--debug']` will output debug information
